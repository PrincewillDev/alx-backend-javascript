# 0x00-ES6_basic

This directory contains a series of exercises designed to introduce you to the fundamental concepts of ES6 (ECMAScript 2015), a major update to the JavaScript language.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

* **Explain what ES6 is:** Understand the significance of this update and its impact on JavaScript development.
* **Describe new features introduced in ES6:** Identify and explain the key additions and changes that ES6 brought to the language.
* **Differentiate between constants and variables:** Understand the difference in behavior and usage between `const` and `let`.
* **Explain block-scoped variables:** Grasp the concept of block scope and how it differs from function scope.
* **Understand arrow functions and default parameters:** Learn how to use arrow functions and how parameters are handled within them.
* **Utilize rest and spread parameters:** Master the use of `...` for collecting arguments and expanding iterables.
* **Employ string templating in ES6:** Use template literals for cleaner and more readable string construction.
* **Create and manipulate objects in ES6:** Understand the new syntax and features for object creation and property access.
* **Work with iterators and for-of loops:** Learn how to iterate over data structures using the `for...of` loop and iterators.

## Project Structure

The directory is organized as follows:

* **`0-constants.js`:** Exploring the use of `const` for declaring constants.
* **`1-block-scoped-variables.js`:** Demonstrating the concept of block scope with `let`.
* **`2-arrow-functions.js`:** Introducing arrow functions and their syntax.
* **`3-spread-syntax.js`:** Exploring the use of the spread syntax (`...`).
* **`4-rest-parameters.js`:** Understanding the use of rest parameters (`...`).
* **`5-string-template.js`:** Utilizing template literals for string construction.
* **`6-object-literals.js`:** Working with object literals and their properties.
* **`7-es6-class.js`:** Exploring the use of classes in ES6.
* **`8-for-of-loops.js`:** Iterating over data structures using `for...of` loops.
* **`9-callback.js`:** Understanding the use of callbacks in JavaScript.
* **`10-promises.js`:** Exploring the use of promises in JavaScript.
* **`11-async-await.js`:** Understanding the use of async/await in JavaScript.
